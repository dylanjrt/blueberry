A database that combines regional data and proximity information, along with Google Ratings of various resource locations. These resource centres are any resources that would be beneficial for the homeless community (mental health services, food bank, emergency shelter, affordable housing). We hope to use this data to predict the optimal resource that should be placed in a given location, based on the factors described above.
